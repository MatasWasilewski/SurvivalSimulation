# SurvivalSimulation
A simple CLI based survival of the fittest simulator; simulating how predators interact with prey in a natural environment, and how populations and genetics can change according to population changes.

# DEPENDENCIES:
In order to run the project, you will need to install the matplotlib library, as this project utilises matplotlib to display data and information about each simulation.

# HOW TO RUN
1. You will have a choice of different running modes - N: Normal, D: Developer, S: Statistic *BE AWARE DEVELOPER AND STATISTIC MODE MAY PERFORM SLOWLY*
2. You will eventually be able to enter various starting population sizes - note this may affect performance. (Recommended - Prey: 300, Food: 750, Predators: 25)
3. You will finally enter some general world settings which may affect how long each populations lives for, etc. Note that lifespan = terms alive, and that mutation must be a float value.
4. Finally, you should see the program begin to run, and each term go by.
